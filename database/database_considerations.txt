MVP:
    Database includes top 250 movies from IMDB by rating
    Database is fixed - no new movies will be added
    Each swipe will trigger a new calculation across the entire dataset
    NoSQL db will be better for fast access and updating the recommendation tracking
V1:
    Expanded list of movies
    More sophisticated data tracking system, so new movies will be able to run seamlessly against previous selections
    Each swipe will update the values pertinent to that selection
    NoSQL db might be better for this application (Firebase? MongoDB?)
